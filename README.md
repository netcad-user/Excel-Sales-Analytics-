AtliQ Hardware has experienced remarkable growth and has decided to prepare a Profit & Loss (P&L) report for data analytics. This initiative aims to provide data-driven insights for comparing market competitors and addressing stakeholder queries across all critical areas, enabling informed and strategic decision-making.

Project Overview:

The project involves organizing and analyzing a large dataset of over 500,000 sales records, which are currently messy. The goal is to extract valuable insights that will help AtliQ Hardware make informed decisions and monitor critical performance metrics. Ultimately, this initiative aims to enhance the company’s overall performance, especially in terms of net sales and gross margin.

As part of this project, I focus on analyzing key financial metrics to drive better business decisions. One key task is calculating the gross margin percentage by quarter to provide a clear view of profitability over time.

Additionally, I develop detailed profit and loss (P&L) reports for different markets, covering net sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross margin, which helps assess market performance.

I also break down P&L data by month to offer insights into short-term performance and generate fiscal year reports for each customer, giving a comprehensive understanding of annual sales trends.

Furthermore, I track net sales across various products, customers, and markets year-over-year. This in-depth data analysis supports the development of strategies that can significantly improve the company's performance.
